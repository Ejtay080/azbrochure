            <p>The three F's are vital in moving anywhere in the world. They stand for Family, Finance, and the Four C's and Food. It requires a lot of research, time and effort. We have compiled a list of the <u>Three F's</u> (This is an acronym to help you find the right choices for your home)  through webpages so you can read and understand our amazing city, Sun City. We hope that you choose to move here, and that you will reccomend Sun City to people you know. Sun City is truly an incredible place, and I would reccomend staying here indefinitely when it comes to retirement. With an amazing culture and people, Sun City will make you feel welcome and always at home.</p>

            <p>The convenience of being in close proximity to the Phoenix area is an added bonus. A lot of relatives you know might live there if you are moving somewhere to move in-state. My grandma and grandpa both live in Sun City and we have visited them numerous times, allowing easy travel to family. I've also been many places in Sun City where family games are played!</p>
